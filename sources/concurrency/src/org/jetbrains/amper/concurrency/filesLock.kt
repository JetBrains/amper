/**
 * Create a target file once and reuse it as a result of further invocations until it is resolved and returned by

 *
 * Method could be used safely from different JVM threads and from different processes.
 *
 * To achieve such concurrency safety, it does the following:
 * - creates a temporary lock file inside the given temp directory ([tempDir]),
 * - takes JVM and inter-process locks on that file
 * - creates a temporary file inside temp directory
 * - under the lock write content to that file with help of the given lambda ([block])
 * - finally, temporary lock file is removed
 * - (temporary file with content is removed as well, but only in case exception was thrown from [block],
 *    otherwise it is a responsibility of given <code>block<code> to remove temp file)
 *
 * The following two restrictions are applied on the input parameters for correct locking logic:
 *  - __MUST__ the same temporary directory is used for the given target file no matter
 *      how many times the method is called (in case a target file is produced by the given [block]);
 *  - __SHOULD__ different target files with the same file names correspond to different temp directories
 *      (if this is not met, some contention might be observed during downloading of such files)
 *
 * Note: Since the first lock is a non-reentrant coroutine [kotlinx.coroutines.sync.Mutex],
 *  callers MUST not call locking methods defined in this utility file again from inside the lambda
 *  ([block]) â€” that would lead to the hanging coroutine.

/**
 * Acquires an exclusive lock on this channel's file, retrying in case of "Resource deadlock avoided" exception.
 * See the "Why retry?" section below for more details.
 *
 * This function blocks until the file can be locked or the current coroutine is canceled, whichever comes first.
 * If a "resource deadlock avoided" exception is thrown, this function suspends and retries several times.
 *
 * File locks are held on behalf of the entire Java virtual machine. They are not suitable for controlling access to a
 * file by multiple threads within the same virtual machine.
 *
 * ### Why retry?
 *
 * The "Resource deadlock avoided" exception is an error coming from the OS itself when it thinks it detects deadlocks.
 * The problem is that this check is at the level of processes and doesn't know about threads. So, if 2 processes both
 * lock the same 2 files at the same time, but each in different threads, the system will think there is a deadlock even
 * when there isn't:
 * * Process 1, thread A, gets lock on file A.
 * * Process 2, thread B, gets lock on file B.
 * * Process 1, thread B, tries to lock file B and blocks.
 * * Process 2, thread A, tries to lock file A and fails with "Resource deadlock avoided" exception.
 *
 * Since we can't really prevent this, our best bet is just to retry a few times to see if the locks are eventually
 * released. If not, we can finally rethrow the exception.
 *
 * @throws ClosedChannelException If this channel is closed
 * @throws AsynchronousCloseException If another thread closes this channel while the invoking thread is blocked in
 *         this function
 * @throws OverlappingFileLockException If a lock that overlaps the requested region is already held by this Java
 *         virtual machine, or if another thread is already blocked in this function and is attempting to lock an
 *         overlapping region of the same file
 * @throws NonWritableChannelException If this channel was not opened for writing
 * @throws IOException If some other I/O error occurs
