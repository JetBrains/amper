# Compose Resources Code Generation

The logic is copied mostly "as is" from compose-multiplatform Gradle Plugin's resources handling code ([here][1]) 
and should be kept in sync until this library is published and shared.

This is a library that is _temporarily_ a part of the Amper project,
but itself is fully independent of it.

No dependencies on any amper modules should be here.
