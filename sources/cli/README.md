# Amper CLI

Amper CLI is a pure Amper command line interface that allows you to run Amper projects without using Gradle.

## Prerequisites

To use Amper CLI, you need to have the following:

- A `curl` installed on your system
- A valid Amper project

## Installation

To install Amper CLI, you need to download the wrapper script to your project's root folder. The wrapper script is 
a small file that downloads and runs the actual Amper CLI distribution.

Depending on your operating system, use one of the following commands to download the wrapper script:

### Linux/mac

```
curl -L "https://maven.pkg.jetbrains.space/public/p/amper/amper/org/jetbrains/amper/cli/cli/0.2.1-dev-468/cli-0.2.1-dev-468-wrapper.sh?download=true" > amper.sh & chmod +x amper.sh
```

### Windows

```
curl -L "https://maven.pkg.jetbrains.space/public/p/amper/amper/org/jetbrains/amper/cli/cli/0.2.1-dev-468/cli-0.2.1-dev-468-wrapper.bat?download=true" > amper.bat
```

Alternatively, you can use any other method to download the wrapper script from the Maven repository, as long as you 
save it with the correct name and extension.

## Usage

To use Amper CLI, you need to run the wrapper script from your project's root folder. The wrapper script will download
the appropriate Amper CLI distribution for your system and execute it.

To run the wrapper script, use one of the following commands, depending on your operating system:

### Linux/mac

```
./amper.sh
```

### Windows

```
amper.bat
```

The first time you run the wrapper script, it will take some time to download the JDK and Amper CLI distribution. 
Subsequent runs will be faster, as the downloaded files will be cached locally.

To explore what is possible using Amper CLI, run the following command:

```
./amper.sh --help
```

This will show you the available options and parameters for the Amper CLI command.
