/**
 * Create a target file once and reuse it as a result of further invocations until its hash is valid.
 *
 * Method could be used safely from different JVM threads and from different processes.
 *
 * To achieve such concurrency safety, it does the following:
 * - creates a temporary lock file inside the temp directory (resolved with the help of given lambda [tempDir]),
 * - takes JVM and inter-process locks on that file
 * - creates a temporary file inside temp directory
 * - under the lock write content to that file with help of the given lambda ([writeFileContent])
 * - after the file was successfully written to temp location, its sha1 hash is stored into the target file directory
 * - finally, temporary file is moved to the target file location.
 *
 * The following two restrictions are applied on the input parameters for correct locking logic:
 *  - __MUST__ the same temporary directory is used for the given target file no matter
 *      how many times the method is called;
 *  - __SHOULD__ different target files with the same file names correspond to different temp directories
 *      (if this is not met, some contention might be observed during downloading of such files)
 *
 * Note: Since the first lock is a non-reentrant coroutine [kotlinx.coroutines.sync.Mutex],
 *  callers MUST not call locking methods defined in this utility file again from inside the lambda
 *  ([writeFileContent]) - that would lead to the hanging coroutine.
