/**
 * This is the entry point to the library.
 *
 * The suggested usage is as follows.
 *
 * 1. Create a resolver instance providing an initial graph of nodes.
 * 2. Build a dependency graph, optionally providing a desired [ResolutionLevel].
 * 3. Optionally, rebuild the graph by providing a higher [ResolutionLevel].
 * 4. Traverse the graph manually or [downloadDependencies] at once.
 *
 * This is how one can download 'kotlin-test' and all its JVM dependencies from Maven Central.
 *
 * ```Kotlin
 * val node = MavenDependencyNode(
 *   Context {
 *     scope = ResolutionScope.COMPILE
 *     platforms = setOf(ResolutionPlatform.JVM)
 *   },
 *   "org.jetbrains.kotlin", "kotlin-test", "1.9.20",
 *   isBom = false
 * )
 * Resolver().buildGraph(node)
 * node.downloadDependencies()
 * val paths = node.dependencyPaths()
 * ```
 *
 * @see DependencyNodeHolderWithContext
 * @see MavenDependencyNode
 * @see Context

class Resolver {

    /**
     * Main entry point into the dependency resolution.
     * It receives an unresolved input graph as the input,
     * resolves transitive dependencies if requested (default behavior) and downloads artifacts corresponding
     * to the nodes of the resolved graph.
     *
     * @param root
     * represents the root node of the input dependencies graph to be resolved.
     * To resolve single maven dependency [MavenDependencyNodeWithContext] might be used,
     * to resolve a list of dependencies [RootDependencyNodeWithContext] might be used,
     * specifying an input dependencies list as children of the root node.
     * Consumers might use other nodes for grouping dependencies, the only requirements to such nodes is that those
     * should be serializable if a consumer wants to benefit from graph resolution cache and specifies non-null [incrementalCacheUsage].
     * See more details on serialization in [org.jetbrains.amper.dependency.resolution.GraphSerializableTypesProvider]
     *
     * @param resolutionLevel
     * If [ResolutionLevel.LOCAL] is passed, dependencies and their artifacts are resolved from
     * local file storage only, if artifact is missing there it is left unresolved. With this resolution level, DR doesn't
     * use network at all.
     * [ResolutionLevel.NETWORK] implies full resolution. If node metadata or artifact is messing locally, it is resolved
     * from the repositories (defined in the resolution context of the node).
     *
     * @param downloadSources Artifacts containing source and documentation (sources, Javadocs) are downloaded from the repositories together
     * with the main artifacts if this flag is set to true.
     *
     * @param transitive Resolve the direct dependencies from the input graph only without transitive ones.
     *
     * @param incrementalCacheUsage instance of the incremental cache to get cached resolution graph from (and store to).
     *
     * @param unspecifiedVersionResolver instance of the [UnspecifiedVersionResolver] to resolve version of dependencies
     * that don't have a version specified in the input graph (or transitive dependencies with an unspecified version as well)
     *
     * @param postProcessDeserializedGraph callback to be called after the graph is resolved and deserialized from the cache.
     * It is useful if some data in the nput graph can't be serialized and thus is marked as [kotlinx.serialization.Transient],
     * but still has to be populated from the input graph to the restored one before it is started using.
     *
     * @return resolved dependencies graph
