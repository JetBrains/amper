 * A trace indicating that the value was derived from another value.

 * The [definitionTrace] is the trace to where the "derivation" (transformation / reference) itself is defined (e.g. a
 * literal reference element like `${module.name}` in the module file). If it's defined directly in Amper's code, we
 * use the [DefaultTrace] as the [definitionTrace].
 *
 * The [sourceValue] is the input value that is copied or transformed into the final value.
 *
 * Example: for the final value of `someProp`, the trace will be a [DerivedValueTrace] configured this way:
 *
 * ```yaml
 * settings:
 *   kotlin:
 *     serialization:
 *       format: json  # 'sourceValue' points here, to where the value comes from

     * For more abstract transformation definitions, this should represent where the transformation itself is defined.

     * In this case, the reference is implicitly defined in the schema as the default value, so its [definitionTrace]

     * in the module file that the `settings.kotlin.version` was set to (or [DefaultTrace] if the property wasn't set
     * explicitly).

     * For more complicated computed values, this should trace to the value that is used as input for the computation
     * or transformation. For example, if we construct Maven coordinates in the code from a default groupId and
     * artifactId, but from a version that comes from a setting, the trace's [sourceValue] is the trace to the version
     * property's value, while the [definitionTrace] is the [DefaultTrace] (concatenation defined in code).
