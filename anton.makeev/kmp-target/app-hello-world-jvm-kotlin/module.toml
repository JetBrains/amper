#  is it OK for the IDE support that it's can only be only determined on the runtme? How to determite it on read-time?
#  how about it's performen once on run-time and added to `lock` (so it's not different from dependency resolution in general)?

# Depend on multi-platform library. Tool will figure out platform-specific version
