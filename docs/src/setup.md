## Setup your IDE

1. Preferably use the latest [IntelliJ IDEA EAP](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/nextversion/). 
   The best way to get the most recent IDE versions is by using the [Toolbox App](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/toolbox/).

2. Make sure to install the [Amper plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23076-amper):

3. [Optional] If you want to write code for Apple platforms or share code between several platforms, install the
   [Kotlin Multiplatform plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform)

4. [Optional] If you want to write some Android-specific code, also install the
   [Android plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22989-android)
