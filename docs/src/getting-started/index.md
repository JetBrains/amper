# Getting started

Ready to try Amper? Great!

## Where to start?

There are different ways to get to know Amper, depending on your needs and preferences:

* :material-note-search: [Examples on GitHub]({{ examples_base_url }}) – to look at complete code examples.

* :material-format-list-numbered: [Tutorial](tutorial.md) – to create a project from the ground up, step-by-step.

* :blue_book: [User guide](../user-guide/index.md) – to learn about Amper concepts, or if you're after a specific topic.

* :material-file-cog: **Start from a template project** – 2 options here:
    * create a new Amper project in IntelliJ IDEA with the Kotlin wizard (first, see [IDE setup](ide-setup.md)), or
    * use `./amper init` (see [CLI setup](cli.md#installation) to get the script).

!!! info "Good tooling rocks!"

    If you choose to write code on your machine, we recommend using IntelliJ IDEA to make the most out of Amper.
    Check our [IDE setup](ide-setup.md) page for more information.
